# Car Value Estimator API

A RESTful API that estimates used car prices based on crowd-sourced reports. Users submit sale prices for vehicles they own; the system averages approved reports with similar make, model, year, mileage, and location to produce an estimate for any queried car.

Built as a hands-on NestJS learning project covering auth, guards, interceptors, TypeORM, and E2E testing.

## What it does

- **Auth** — sign up / sign in / sign out via cookie-based sessions; passwords hashed with `scrypt` + salt
- **Reports** — authenticated users submit car sale reports (make, model, year, mileage, location, price)
- **Approval** — admins approve or reject submitted reports
- **Estimation** — query `/reports/estimate` to get an average price from up to 3 approved reports matching make/model, ±3 years, ±5° lat/lng, sorted by closest mileage

## Tech stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| Framework | NestJS 11 (Express) |
| Language | TypeScript 5 |
| ORM | TypeORM 0.3 |
| Database | SQLite (file-based, zero setup) |
| Auth | cookie-session + scrypt |
| Validation | class-validator / class-transformer |
| Config | @nestjs/config + `.env.*` files |
| Testing | Jest + Supertest (unit + E2E) |

## Key patterns

- **Dependency injection** — NestJS constructor-based DI throughout
- **DTO validation + serialization** — separate DTOs for input (class-validator) and output (class-transformer `@Expose`)
- **Custom guards** — `AuthGuard` (session check) and `AdminGuard` (role check) protecting routes declaratively
- **Custom decorator** — `@CurrentUser()` pulls the authenticated user from the request inside controllers
- **Interceptors** — `SerializeInterceptor` strips sensitive fields (e.g. password) from responses
- **Middleware** — `CurrentUserMiddleware` resolves the user entity from the session on every request
- **Environment-split databases** — `.env.dev` / `.env.test` point to separate SQLite files so E2E tests never touch dev data

## Running locally

```bash
npm install
npm run start:dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

```bash
npm run test        # unit tests
npm run test:e2e    # end-to-end tests
```

> Requires Node 20+. No external database needed — SQLite files are created automatically.
